Skillmentor: Full-Stack Peer Tutoring Platform

Skillmentor is a complete full-stack web application designed to connect students with expert peer mentors for personalized 1-on-1 tutoring sessions. Built with a modern technology stack, the platform provides a seamless experience for both students and administrators.

The backend is powered by Spring Boot and secured with Spring Security, offering a robust REST API for managing classes, mentors, and bookings. The frontend is a dynamic single-page application built with React and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for a clean, modern, and fully responsive user interface.

Key features include secure user authentication via Clerk, role-based access control (distinguishing between students and administrators), and a comprehensive admin dashboard with data visualizations for monitoring platform activity. The project is deployed with a CI/CD pipeline, utilizing Vercel for the frontend, Railway for the backend, and a Supabase PostgreSQL database, showcasing a complete, production-ready architecture.
